<p><b>Population:</b> The entire group of individuals or instances about whom we hope to learn.
</p>
<p><b>Sample:</b> A (representative) subset of a population, examined in hope of learning about the
population.</p>

<p><b>Sample survey:</b> A study that asks questions of a sample drawn from some population in the hope
of learning
something about the entire population. Polls taken to assess voter preferences are common sample
surveys.</p>

<p><b>Bias:</b> Any systematic failure of a sampling method to represent its population is bias. Biased
sampling
methods tend to over- or underestimate parameters. It is almost impossible to recover from bias,
so efforts to avoid it are well spent. Common errors include</p>
<ul>
    <li>relying on voluntary response.</li>
    <li>undercoverage of the population.</li>
    <li>nonresponse bias.</li>
    <li>response bias.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Randomization:</b> The best defense against bias is randomization, in which each individual is
given a fair, random
chance of selection.</p>

<p><b>Sample size:</b> The number of individuals in a sample. The sample size determines how well the
sample represents
the population, not the fraction of the population sampled.</p>

<p><b>Census:</b> A sample that consists of the entire population is called a census.
</p>
<p><b>Population parameter:</b> A numerically valued attribute of a model for a population. We rarely
expect to know the true
value of a population parameter, but we do hope to estimate it from sampled data. For example, the
mean income of all employed people in the country is a population parameter.</p>

<p><b>Statistic, sample statistic:</b> Statistics are values calculated for sampled data. Those that
correspond to, and thus estimate,
a population parameter, are of particular interest. For example, the mean income of all employed
people in a representative sample can provide a good estimate of the corresponding population
parameter.
The term “sample statistic” is sometimes used, usually to parallel the corresponding term
“population parameter.”</p>

<p><b>Representative:</b> A sample is said to be representative if the statistics computed from it
accurately reflect the
corresponding population parameters.</p>

<p><b>Simple random sample (SRS):</b> A simple random sample of sample size is a sample in which each
set of elements in the
population has an equal chance of selection.</p>

<p><b>Sampling frame:</b> A list of individuals from whom the sample is drawn is called the sampling
frame. Individuals
who may be in the population of interest, but who are not in the sampling frame, cannot be included
in any sample.</p>

<p><b>Sampling variability:</b> The natural tendency of randomly drawn samples to differ, one from
another. Sometimes, unfortunately,
called sampling error, sampling variability is no error at all, but just the natural result of
random sampling.</p>

<p><b>Stratified random sample:</b> A sampling design in which the population is divided into several
subpopulations, or strata,
and random samples are then drawn from each stratum. If the strata are homogeneous, but are
different
from each other, a stratified sample may yield more consistent results than an SRS.</p>

<p><b>Cluster sample:</b> A sampling design in which entire groups, or clusters, are chosen at random.
Cluster sampling
is usually selected as a matter of convenience, practicality, or cost. Each cluster should be
representative
of the population, so all the clusters should be heterogeneous and similar to each other.</p>

<p><b>Multistage sample:</b> Sampling schemes that combine several sampling methods are called
multistage samples. For
example, a national polling service may stratify the country by geographical regions, select a
random
sample of cities from each region, and then interview a cluster of residents in each city.</p>

<p><b>Systematic sample:</b> A sample drawn by selecting individuals systematically from a sampling
frame. When there is
no relationship between the order of the sampling frame and the variables of interest, a systematic
sample can be representative.</p>

<p><b>Pilot:</b> A small trial run of a survey to check whether questions are clear. A pilot study can
reduce errors
due to ambiguous questions.</p>

<p><b>Voluntary response bias:</b> Bias introduced to a sample when individuals can choose on their own
whether to participate
in the sample. Samples based on voluntary response are always invalid and cannot be recovered, no
matter how large the sample size.</p>

<p><b>Convenience sample:</b> A convenience sample consists of the individuals who are conveniently
available. Convenience
samples often fail to be representative because every individual in the population is not equally
convenient
to sample.</p>

<p><b>Undercoverage:</b> A sampling scheme that biases the sample in a way that gives a part of the
population less
representation than it has in the population suffers from undercoverage.</p>

<p><b>Nonresponse bias:</b> Bias introduced when a large fraction of those sampled fails to respond.
Those who do respond
are likely to not represent the entire population. Voluntary response bias is a form of nonresponse
bias, but nonresponse may occur for other reasons. For example, those who are at work during
the day won’t respond to a telephone survey conducted only during working hours.</p>

<p><b>Response bias:</b> Anything in a survey design that influences responses falls under the heading
of response bias.
One typical response bias arises from the wording of questions, which may suggest a favored
response.
Voters, for example, are more likely to express support of “the president” than support of
the particular person holding that office at the moment.</p>
